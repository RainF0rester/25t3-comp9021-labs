def prime_factors_of_1(n: int) -> None:
    """
    Prints the prime factorization of a given natural number n.

    If n < 2, the function simply returns (since 0 and 1 have no prime factors).
    Otherwise, it prints the prime decomposition of n in ascending order,
    showing exponents only when greater than 1.

    Example:
        >>> prime_factors_of(60)
        60 = 2^2 x 3 x 5

        >>> prime_factors_of(97)
        97 = 97

    Algorithm overview:
        1. Handle the trivial case (n < 2).
        2. Extract all factors of 2.
        3. Repeatedly test odd numbers (3, 5, 7, …) up to √rest
           to find other prime factors.
        4. If no smaller divisor is found, the remaining number is prime.
        5. Print the formatted decomposition.

    Args:
        n (int): The natural number to factorize (n >= 0)

    Returns:
        None — the result is printed directly.
