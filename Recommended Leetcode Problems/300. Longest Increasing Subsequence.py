"""
We use DP to solve the problem.

1. DP definition: dp[i] = the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i
Each subsequence must end with some number,
so it’s natural to define it as “ending at nums[i]”.
That helps compare previous elements (nums[j] < nums[i]).

2. Transition: dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
If the current number nums[i] is larger than nums[j],
then nums[i] can be added after the sequence that ends at nums[j].

3. Initialization: dp = [1] * n
Each element itself can form a subsequence of length 1.

4. Traversal order
i goes from left to right.
For each i, check all previous j from 0 to i-1.
This ensures smaller indexes are already computed.

5. Result
The final answer is the maximum value in dp,
because the longest subsequence might end anywhere.
