    Demonstrates how to use unpacking (*) together with reversed()
    to build mirrored tuples from an arbitrary number of integers.

    1. Inside the function definition, *L packs all input arguments into a tuple.
    2. Inside the return expression, *L and *reversed(L) unpack values again
       — the first unpacks the tuple, the second unpacks a reversed iterator.

    This function creates two tuples:
    1. The first tuple concatenates all elements of L followed by their reversed order.
    2. The second tuple does the opposite: reversed elements first, then the original ones.

    It illustrates how * (unpacking) can expand iterable elements directly inside a tuple.
    Only *, list, and reversed are used — no loops or comprehensions.
